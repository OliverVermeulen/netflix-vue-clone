# VUE Netflix clone

## Description
The aim of this project is to use VUE to make a functional clone of Netflix


## Features
1. The ability to sign in and out
2. A search bar that can search by Title or Genre
3. A banner of upcoming movies with clickable information buttons that gives more information on the movie and or series
4. A page for displaying the items in your watch list
  

## MVP
- Ensure that the landing page looks like the Netflix landing page
- Allow users to add and delete movies from the watchlist
- Have a max of 20 movies on the watchlist
- Watchlist movies remain in place even after page refresh
- Search a movie by name or actor's name
- There is no need to include a login page, but we won't stop you if you do
