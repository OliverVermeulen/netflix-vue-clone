# VUE Netflix clone

## Description
The aim of this project is to use VUE to make a functional clone of Netflix


## Features
1. A search bar that can search by Title, Genre or People
2. Clickable information buttons that gives more information on the movie and or series
3. Pages that display Films and Series separately
4. A page for displaying the items in your watch list
  

## MVP
- Ensure that the landing page looks like the Netflix landing page
- Allow users to add and delete movies from the watchlist
- Have a max of 20 movies on the watchlist
- Watchlist movies remain in place even after page refresh
- Include a coming soon banner to the top of all movies that have a property of coming soon equal to 1
- Set a reminder of when to watch a movie that is coming soon (be creative)
- Search a movie by name or actor's name
- There is no need to include a login page, but we won't stop you if you do


## Backlog
- add separate pages
- add tasks to watch list
